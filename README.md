# Crime Analysis

## Overview
The Crime Analysis System is an intelligent database designed to streamline crime scene investigation and analysis. Leveraging images, videos, audio, and text, this project aims to enhance forensic procedures for law enforcement agencies.

## Why This Project
Traditional crime analysis lacks efficiency, often relying on manual data examination. This project addresses the need for an intelligent, adaptable system that integrates various data types to provide a comprehensive view of crime scenes.

## Methodology
Utilizing a manually constructed database, this system focuses on user-friendly tables for advocates and police. The project implements an authentication system, allowing secure storage, retrieval, and real-time updates of case-related information.

## Discussions
The project successfully stores and retrieves case data, improving case administration for law enforcement officials. However, there's room for improvement, particularly in face authentication and image detection algorithms. Contributions and enhancements are welcome.
